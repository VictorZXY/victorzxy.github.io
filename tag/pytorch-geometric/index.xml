      <title>Enhancing Real-World Complex Network Representations with Topological Augmentation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graph augmentation methods play a crucial role in improving the performance and enhancing generalisation capabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing graph augmentation methods mainly perturb the graph structures, and are usually limited to pairwise node relations. These methods cannot fully address the complexities of real-world large-scale networks, which often involve higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present &lt;em&gt;Topological Augmentation (TopoAug)&lt;/em&gt;, a novel graph augmentation method that builds a combinatorial complex from the original graph by constructing virtual hyperedges directly from the raw data. TopoAug then produces auxiliary node features by extracting information from the combinatorial complex, which are used for enhancing GNN performances on downstream tasks. We design three diverse virtual hyperedge construction strategies to accompany the construction of combinatorial complexes: (1) via graph statistics, (2) from multiple data perspectives, and (3) utilising multi-modality. Furthermore, to facilitate TopoAug evaluation, we provide 23 novel real-world graph datasets across various domains including social media, biology, and e-commerce. Our empirical study shows that TopoAug consistently and significantly outperforms GNN baselines and other graph augmentation methods, across a variety of application contexts, which clearly indicates that it can effectively incorporate higher-order node relations into the graph augmentation for real-world complex networks. Specifically, on the Amazon datasets, our method surpasses the GCN baseline by 37.0% on average, outperforms GAT by 30.8% on average, and exceeds GraphSAGE by 33.8% on average.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating GNN Expressiveness in Graph Generation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/expressive-graph-gen-extend/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graph generation poses a significant challenge as it involves predicting a complete graph with multiple nodes and edges based on simply a given label. This task also carries fundamental importance to numerous real-world applications, including de-novo drug and molecular design. In recent years, several successful methods have emerged in the field of graph generation. However, these approaches suffer from two significant shortcomings: (1) the underlying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures used in these methods are often underexplored; and (2) these methods are often evaluated on only a limited number of metrics. To fill this gap, we investigate the expressiveness of GNNs under the context of the molecular graph generation task, by replacing the underlying GNNs of graph generative models with more expressive GNNs. Specifically, we analyse the performance of six GNNs in two different generative frameworks—autoregressive generation models, such as GCPN and GraphAF, and one-shot generation models, such as GraphEBM—on six different molecular generative objectives on the ZINC-250k dataset. Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate that advanced GNNs can indeed improve the performance of GCPN, GraphAF, and GraphEBM on molecular generation tasks, but GNN expressiveness is not a necessary condition for a good GNN-based generative model. Moreover, we show that GCPN and GraphAF with advanced GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art results across 17 other non-GNN-based graph generative approaches, such as variational autoencoders and Bayesian optimisation models, on the proposed molecular generative objectives (DRD2, Median1, Median2), which are important metrics for de-novo molecular design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unifying Higher-Order Graph Representation with New Datasets and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/hybrid-graph-benchmark/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graphs are widely used to encapsulate a variety of data formats, but real-world networks often involve complex node relations beyond only being pairwise. While hypergraphs and hierarchical graphs have been developed and employed to account for the complex node relations, they cannot fully represent these complexities in practice. Additionally, though many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed for representation learning on higher-order graphs, they are usually only evaluated on simple graph datasets. Therefore, there is a need for a unified modelling of higher-order graphs, and a collection of comprehensive datasets with an accessible evaluation framework to fully understand the performance of these algorithms on complex graphs. In this paper, we introduce the concept of hybrid graphs, a unified definition for higher-order graphs, and present the Hybrid Graph Benchmark (HGB). HGB contains 23 real-world hybrid graph datasets across various domains such as biology, social media, and e-commerce. Furthermore, we provide an extensible evaluation framework and a supporting codebase to facilitate the training and evaluation of GNNs on HGB. Our empirical study of existing GNNs on HGB reveals various research opportunities and gaps, including (1) evaluating the actual performance improvement of hypergraph GNNs over simple graph GNNs; (2) comparing the impact of different sampling strategies on hybrid graph learning methods; and (3) exploring ways to integrate simple graph and hypergraph information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid growth over the last decade, and have been successful in many real-world applications. In order to cope with the rapid growth of this field, it is increasingly demanding to develop reliable GNN evaluation methods to facilitate GNN research and quantify their progress. Current GNN benchmarking methods all focus on comparing the GNNs with respect to their training performances on some node/graph classification/regression tasks in certain datasets, but there has not been any principled, task-agnostic method to directly compare the two GNNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, learning informative representations of graph-structured data using self-supervised learning (SSL) is becoming crucial in many real-world tasks nowadays, when labelled data are expensive and limited. Most of the existing graph SSL works incorporate handcrafted augmentations to the graph, which has several severe difficulties due to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. Therefore, it is highly needed to develop a principled SSL framework across various types of graphs, that does not require handcrafted augmentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, I tackled both questions above, and developed &lt;em&gt;GraphAC (Graph Adversarial Collaboration)&lt;/em&gt;, a conceptually novel, principled, task-agnostic, and stable framework for evaluating GNNs through contrastive self-supervision. It consists of two different GNNs directly competing against each other, with the more expressive GNN wins by producing more informative graph representations. I built two frameworks for GraphAC, and designed a novel objective function that enables stable and effective training of two different GNNs, inspired by Barlow Twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experimental results show that GraphAC succeeds in distinguishing GNNs of different expressivity across various aspects including the number of layers, hidden dimensionality, aggregators, GNN architecture and edge features, and always allow more expressive GNNs to win with statistically significant difference. GraphAC proved to be a principled and reliable GNN evaluation method, and enables stable SSL without needing handcrafted augmentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://victorzxy.github.io/publication/2023-graphac&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from this dissertation has been published at the 11th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023) Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (MLDD) Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
