However, GPs suffer from unscalability as they become very computationally expensive on large datasets, and choosing the appropriate priors for GPs can be nontrivial. In this project, I investigated a neural network (NN) alternative to GPs, and introduced the function autoencoders that preserve GPs’ own advantages and avoid their weaknesses with NNs’ benefits. I tested the performance of the various function autoencoders on a 1-dimensional function regression task, using random functions generated by a GP with varying kernel parameters, and compared and analysed their results. The trained function autoencoder models indeed have the ability to learn distributions over random functions, and performed decently on the selected task.

In this project, I built a Windows desktop application in C#, that provides a classroom teaching tool for graph theory, particularly in the following algorithms:\nPrim’s and Kruskal’s minimum spanning trees algorithms Dijkstra’s single-source shortest paths algorithm The teaching tool enables a user to freely create a graph by filling in an adjacency matrix/list, and also provides a Sketch Board which allows a user to directly draw the graph on a canvas. It then applies the graph algorithms on the created graph, with step-by-step demonstrations. It also embeds a Question Bank for teachers to set, edit and store questions and students to answer them, together with an automatic marking system, and can keep track of the learning progress of each student.\n","date":1524009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524009600,"objectID":"089c29991b94353045c6e1cde6699450","permalink":"https://victorzxy.github.io/project/graph-teaching-tool/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/graph-teaching-tool/","section":"project","summary":"A-Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment.","tags":["Graph Theory"],"title":"A Classroom Teaching Tool for Graph Theory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiangyu Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":946684801,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":946684801,"objectID":"4779797a6fcce6696048053150c763ba","permalink":"https://victorzxy.github.io/note/et2b-dissertation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/note/et2b-dissertation/","section":"note","summary":"Economics Tripos, Part IIB, University of Cambridge","tags":null,"title":"Economics BA Dissertation Template","type":"note"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"65de3680a280f6bf29dc34fe1adad5a6","permalink":"https://victorzxy.github.io/talks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
