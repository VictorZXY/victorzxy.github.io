I have a strong enthusiasm in deep learning, particularly in self-supervised learning and graph representation learning. I am also very interested in reinforcement learning and generative models. My current research interest is to explore machine learning methods that involve no or less manual data labelling or augmentations, in order to reduce the reliance of specialised human knowledge on the tasks. In my Master’s dissertation, I developed a conceptually novel, principled, task-agnostic, and stable framework for evaluating GNN expressivity through contrastive self-supervision, supervised by Prof Pietro Liò, Dr Dominique Beaini and Hannes Stärk. I am currently working on building powerful GNNs without the need of pre-defined node embeddings, supervised by Dr Aaron Zhao and Prof Robert Mullins.\nOutside of academics, I am a keen clarinettist, a 2-kyu beginner kendoka, and a goalkeeper.

Current state-of-the-art NER systems can achieve F1-scores of up to 94.6% on English news texts (Wang et al., 2021a), where the named entities are fairly standard, well-formed and highly predictable. However, the diverse and noisy nature of user-generated texts as well as the novel, emerging and rare named entities make NER in social media much more challenging, and standard NER sysmtes were not found to work very well on these tasks. As a comparison, current state-of-the-art NER systems on user-generated texts can only achieve F1-scores of up to 60.45% (Wang et al., 2021b). In this project, I investigated a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) structure for NER on social media texts, explored various data-processing techniques in order to improve the model’s performance, namely:\n Downweighting non-named entity labels Downsampling non-named entity tokens Merging named entity labels Adding part-of-speech (PoS) embeddings  I then evaluated my trained models on the W-NUT 2017 shared task on novel and emerging entity recognition.
