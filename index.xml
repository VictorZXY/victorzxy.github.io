      <title>Function Autoencoders: A Neural Network Approach to Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/function-autoencoders/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gaussian processes (GPs) are data-efficient and flexible probabilistic methods that learn distributions of functions based on given priors. However, GPs suffer from unscalability as they become very computationally expensive on large datasets, and choosing the appropriate priors for GPs can be nontrivial. In this project, I investigated a neural network (NN) alternative to GPs, and introduced the function autoencoders that preserve GPs’ own advantages and avoid their weaknesses with NNs’ benefits. I tested the performance of the various function autoencoders on a 1-dimensional function regression task, using random functions generated by a GP with varying kernel parameters, and compared and analysed their results. The trained function autoencoder models indeed have the ability to learn distributions over random functions, and performed decently on the selected task. Moreover, the function autoencoders demonstrate a great potential for further improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Simulator and Emulator for Traffic Signaling</title>

      <guid>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/traffic-sim/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, we carried out simulation and emulation of an urban traffic signalling system. We first built a simulator that can randomly generate networks and car routes to test how different signal scheduling choices affect the total distance travelled by cars in a given period. Based on this, we built an emulator to search for optimal scheduling using Bayesian optimisation. To overcome the problem of exploding search space without sacrificing flexibility or descriptiveness, we introduced four different scheduling schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinct scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniform scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preset scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced-preset scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then conducted experiments on very small networks (5 junctions), small networks (40 junctions) and medium networks (200 junctions) to compare their performances. Results show that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preset scheduling gives the best convergence limit under reasonable number of iterations in most cases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniform and distinct scheduling give much poorer performance due to their own limitations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced-preset scheduling does show certain potential in some cases, but is rather unstable compared to preset scheduling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the combination of Bayesian optimisation with traffic planning offers some novel insights and has much more potential to be discovered. With sufficient research effort, this area would bring great benefit to city planners and the general public, with potential applications in other areas that involves network traffic controls.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Neural Network Approach to Named Entity Recognition on Noisy User-Generated Texts</title>
      <link>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/nlp-final-assignment-ner/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/nlp-final-assignment-ner/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Named entity recognition (NER) is an important information extraction task in natural language processing (NLP) which involves automatic identification of entities of interest, such as people&amp;rsquo;s names, organisations and locations. Current state-of-the-art NER systems can achieve F1-scores of up to 94.6% on English news texts (&lt;a href=&#34;https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.206.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wang &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2021a&lt;/a&gt;), where the named entities are fairly standard, well-formed and highly predictable. However, the diverse and noisy nature of user-generated texts as well as the novel, emerging and rare named entities make NER in social media much more challenging, and standard NER sysmtes were not found to work very well on these tasks. As a comparison, current state-of-the-art NER systems on user-generated texts can only achieve F1-scores of up to 60.45% (&lt;a href=&#34;https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.142.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wang &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2021b&lt;/a&gt;). In this project, I investigated a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) structure for NER on social media texts, explored various data-processing techniques in order to improve the model&amp;rsquo;s performance, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downweighting non-named entity labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downsampling non-named entity tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merging named entity labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding part-of-speech (PoS) embeddings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then evaluated my trained models on the W-NUT 2017 shared task on novel and emerging entity recognition. The model trained with data-processing techniques applied has achieved significant improvements on performance, compared to the model with the same structure, but trained on the original dataset without any optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mahjong</title>
      <link>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/meowjong/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mahjong is a popular multi-player imperfect-information game developed in China in the late 19th-century, with some very challenging features for AI research. Sanma, being a 3-player variant of the Japanese Riichi Mahjong, possesses unique characteristics including fewer tiles and, consequently, a more aggressive playing style. It is thus challenging and of great research interest in its own right, but has not yet been explored. In this project, I built Meowjong, an AI for Sanma using deep reinforcement learning. I defined an informative and compact 2-dimensional data structure for encoding the observable information in a Sanma game. Then, I pre-trained 5 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Sanma&amp;rsquo;s 5 actions—discard, Pon, Kan, Kita and Riichi, and enhanced the major action&amp;rsquo;s model, namely the discard model, via self-play reinforcement learning using the Monte Carlo policy gradient method. I have also implemeted necessary additional modules including data collection and processing, Mahjong hand calculation and a game simulator, for the agents to be trained and evaluated. Meowjong&amp;rsquo;s models have achieved test accuracies comparable with AIs for 4-player Mahjong through supervised learning, and gained a significant further enhancement from reinforcement learning. Being the first ever AI in Sanma, Meowjong stands as a state-of-the-art in this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper from this dissertation has been submitted to IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating Adversarial Examples for Deep Residual Networks</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/fgsm-attack-resnets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I investigated the one-shot and iterative fast gradient sign method (FGSM) attack, both untargeted and targeted, to generate adversarial examples for ResNet-50, and experimented the transferability of each FGSM to other neural networks, namely ResNet-18 and VGG-19, as well as other image inputs. The following conclusions can be reached after the above experiments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted FGSM is more effective than FGSM;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In white-box attacks, both the untargeted and targeted one-shot FGSMs are less effective than the iterative methods (both untargeted and targeted);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to transferability to other neural networks or inputs, the one-shot FGSMs turn out to be much more effective than the iterative FGSMs, as the iterative FGSMs suffer from overfitting and hence completely unable to transfer to other neural networks or inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since transferability is a foundation to black-box attacks, it is likely that the one-shot FGSMs can also be more effective than the iterative FGSMs in black-box attacks.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I analysed a clickstream dataset of an online shopping website for clothing between April and August 2008, and built a machine learning pipeline to predict the costumer’s potential willingness to pay a premium price. I explored, trained and compared various machine learning models for this task, ranging from traditional models to deep neural networks, and identified the most important features for predicting the target value. The best-performing model the I trained for this project has achieved a test accuracy of 93.37%. I also performed visualisation and dimensionality reduction, using PCA and t-SNE, to reveal properties of the dataset and my models.&lt;/p&gt;

The Trading Assistant holds market data and responds to queries on demand in a human-like manner, by automating the trader side of the trading communication using modern technologies, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis. The speech recognition and speech synthesis module of the Trading Assistant was built based on the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs. The Trading Assistant also adopts a Naïve Bayes approach for NLP, using word2vec for word embeddings and Siamese BERT for sentence embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was responsible for building the speech recognition and speech synthesis modules, and efficiently built the libraries with high accuracies, and provided clean interfaces that were used conveniently by my NLP and back-end teammates, improving the system&amp;rsquo;s overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an Android application, written in Java, for the athletes in Cambridge. It gives a daily weather forecast information on the most relevant weather, based on the user&amp;rsquo;s selection of sports. I was responsible for layout design and interaction functionalities, and built an aesthetic, easy-to-use and efficient user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Classroom Teaching Tool for Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://victorzxy.github.io/post/graph-teaching-tool/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graph theory is an important part in A-Level mathematics and computer science subjects. A good majority of students who are studying mathematics, further mathematics or computer science need a more hands-on approach to this very abstract subject which lies at the heart of computer science, and a detailed and easy-understandable teaching tool is essential to their understandings about graph theory. Unfortunately, however, such a teaching tool is quite rare to find in the majority of academic supportive websites. In this project, I built a Windows desktop application in C#, that provides a classroom teaching tool for graph theory, particularly in the following algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prim&amp;rsquo;s and Kruskal&amp;rsquo;s minimum spanning trees algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s single-source shortest paths algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teaching tool enables a user to freely create a graph by filling in an adjacency matrix/list, and also provides a Sketch Board which allows a user to directly draw the graph on a canvas. It then applies the graph algorithms on the created graph, with step-by-step demonstrations. It also embeds a Question Bank for teachers to set, edit and store questions and students to answer them, together with an automatic marking system, and can keep track of the learning progress of each student.&lt;/p&gt;
